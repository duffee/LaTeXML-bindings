LaTeXML-bindings
================

Contributed bindings to the LaTeXML project relevant to a segment of the arXiv.org repository,
specifically files relating to publications on the topic of Dark Matter or Modified Newtonian Dynamics.
The LaTeXML project can be found at http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/ or https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML

Bindings are written in Perl and used to render the LaTeX/TeX stored in stylefiles and class files into XML.
